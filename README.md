Suppose you play 10000 games of blackjack using perfect basic strategy (as described in https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/BJA_Basic_Strategy.jpg),
how well would you do? That is what this project aims to understand. This project is a simulation that runs 10000 rounds of blackjack. The player starts with 
$100 and bets 10% of it every round. The player only sees 1 of the dealers cards and plays according to the basic strategy. After 10000 rounds, the amount of wins, loses,
pushes, and money earned is displayed.
